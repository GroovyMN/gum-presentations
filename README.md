Ask a question
------------------------------------
Asking a question is as easy as [creating a new issue](http://github.com/GroovyMN/gum-presentations/issues) on this project.

We'll answer it as soon as we can get to it, but that usually takes a few days. Once we answer, we'll close the issue so we know what we've responded to. But, don't worry â€“ if you have further questions, just respond in the issue thread and we'll get back to you. Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't originally create it.

Read some questions
------------------------------------
Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/GroovyMN/gum-presentations//feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1) filter on this repository to browse questions we've answered in the past. We try to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig into some of the older threads.

[DOSUG](https://github.com/DOSUG/feedback) had an idea about feedback and we proudly copied, search and replaced some of the text.

The idea of a feedback repo and some of the text here was proudly copied from Zach Holman and his [feedback repo](https://github.com/holman/feedback).
